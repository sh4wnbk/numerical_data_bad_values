# Numerical Data and Bad Values
The dataset for this exercise is fictitious. It contains 1,400 rows. 

Each row contains the following two columns:
calories, which is the number of breakfast calories as determined by a nutritionist.
test_score, which is the student's score on a math test. A reliable program determines the value of test_score.

The data pool consists of 50 students, each evaluated on 28 consecutive days. So, rows 0-49 show how each of the students 
performed on the first day, rows 50-99 show how each of the students performed on the second day, and so on.

The dataset aims to determine the relationship between the number of calories a student ate for breakfast 
and their test scores. However, your goal is simply to determine whether some values in the dataset are bad.
